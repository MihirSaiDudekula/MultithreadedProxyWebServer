# Multithreaded Proxy Web Server Documentation

## Overview
This project implements a multithreaded proxy web server that demonstrates the performance benefits of caching and proxying in web applications. The system consists of two main components:

1. **Express Server**: A backend server that handles actual data processing and storage
2. **Proxy Server**: A caching proxy that sits between clients and the Express server

## System Architecture

### 1. Express Server (`server.js`)
- Built using Node.js and Express framework
- Provides RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User management (CRUD operations)
  - Large data transfer testing
  - Test endpoints for server status
- Implements error handling middleware
- Runs on port 3000

### 2. Proxy Server
- Acts as an intermediary between clients and the Express server
- Implements caching mechanism to improve performance
- Handles large data requests efficiently
- Runs on port 8080

## Working Principle

1. **Request Flow**:
   - Client requests are first received by the Proxy Server
   - The proxy checks its cache for the requested resource
   - If cached, returns the response immediately (cache hit)
   - If not cached, forwards the request to the Express Server
   - Stores the response in cache before returning to client

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Caching reduces load on the Express Server
   - Large data requests are handled more efficiently
   - Multiple concurrent requests can be processed
   - Response times are improved through caching

## Testing and Validation

The project includes a comprehensive test suite ([script.py](cci:7://file:///e:/coding/MTPS/Final%20Version/script.py:0:0-0:0)) that:

1. Verifies server status
2. Tests large data transfer capabilities
3. Measures performance metrics
4. Generates performance visualizations
5. Provides detailed performance analysis

## Key Features

- Multi-threaded request handling
- Intelligent caching mechanism
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Load balancing capabilities
- Error handling and logging
- Large data transfer optimization

## Use Cases

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Ideal for high-traffic web applications
   - Reduces server load through caching
   - Improves response times for repeated requests

2. **Load Distribution**:
   - Distributes traffic between multiple backend servers
   - Handles concurrent requests efficiently
   - Provides failover capabilities

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Tracks request performance
   - Provides detailed analytics
   - Generates performance reports

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Node.js is installed
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Express server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. Start the Proxy server (implementation details in proxy server code)
5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks and analyzes:
- Response times
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Server status
- Error rates
- Throughput
- Large data transfer performance

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement SSL/TLS support
2. Add rate limiting
3. Improve cache eviction policies
4. Add request compression
5. Implement request routing rules
